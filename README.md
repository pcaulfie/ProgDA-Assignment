# About ProgDA-Assignment
This repository contains my submission for Assignment 2019 for Programming for Data Analysis course. The assignment concerns the numpy.random package in Python 3. I have created a [Jupyter notebook](http://https://github.com/pcaulfie/ProgDA-Assignment/blob/master/ProgDA-Assignment.ipynb) explaining the use of the package, including detailed explanations of six of the distributions provided for in the package.

## Problem statement
There are four distinct tasks carried out in my Jupyter notebook.
1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and  “Permutations” functions.
4. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
5. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudo-random numbers.

## Installation

- I recommend that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution of python which contains all the libraries used, as well an instance of Jupyter notebook.
