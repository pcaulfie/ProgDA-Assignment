    "## Overview of Numpy.Random Package\n",
    "McLoughlin (2019) describes the numpy.random package as a sub-package of the Numpy in Python. The package contains algorithms to generate pseudo-random numbers (Sharpsight, 2019). According to The SciPy community (2019), the numpy.ramdom package generates pseudo-random numbers using a combination of a bit generator and a random generator. The bit generator creates sequences of values and the random generator transforms these sequences into statistical distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What Are Pseudo Random Numbers\n",
    "According to Wolfram Research (2019), a pseudo-random number is the name given to a computer-generated random number. Computer Hope (2019) points out that computer generated random numbers are not properly random, because computers are deterministic by design. Because, when a computer is working properly, it's behaviour is predictable, not random. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rubin (2011) cites an article at MIT’s School of Engineering, which clarifies the meaning of the term deterministic as: “if you ask the same question you’ll get the same answer every time.” To quote Sharpsight (2019) \"give a computer the same input, it will produce the same output.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Accordinto to Sharpsight (2019), to resolve the problem of generating “random” numbers, algorithms called Pseudo-Random Number Generators which produce numbers which appear to be random.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets look at some pseudo-random numbers created with the NumPy to see if we can see any pattern."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When Should The NumPy Random Binomial Function Be Used\n",
    "The SciPy Community (2018) suggest that binomial distribution should be used instead of the normal distribution when \"the product p x n <=5, where p = population proportion estimate, and n = number of samples\". This function can be used to model real world processes which can be easily categorised into pass / fail trials. For example, when you toss a coin multiple times, how many times will it land on its head. Other use cases include the probability of success in oil exploration, estimating the number of defects in a production line or the odds of a penalty being saved in a football match.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, cmdline (2018) suggests that the binomial function is appropriate function to use to simulate a coin toss experiment. Where n is the number of times you toss a coin, where the probability of getting head each coin toss is p. Assuming  you toss a coint 10 times, and you get 5 heads and 5 tails. Therefore the probability of getting head at each coin toss (p) is 5 / 10 = 0.5. To test if the binomial distribution should be used we multipy p x n ie 0.5 x 10 = 5, since p x n <=5, we can conclude that the binomial distribution should be used in this case.\n",

    "\n",
    "*Paraphrase - Sharpsight 2019 - We use np.random.seed when we need to generate random numbers or mimic random processes in NumPy.Computers are generally deterministic, so it’s very difficult to create truly “random” numbers on a computer. Computers get around this by using pseudo-random number generators.These pseudo-random number generators are algorithms that produce numbers that appear random, but are not really random.In order to work properly, pseudo-random number generators require a starting input. We call this starting input a “seed.” The code np.random.seed(0) enables you to provide a seed (i.e., the starting input) for NumPy’s pseudo-random number generator.NumPy then uses the seed and the pseudo-random number generator in conjunction with other functions from the numpy.random namespace to produce certain types of random outputs.Ultimately, creating pseudo-random numbers this way leads to repeatable output, which is good for testing and code sharing.*"
