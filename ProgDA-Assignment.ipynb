    "## Overview of Numpy.Random Package\n",
    "McLoughlin (2019) describes the numpy.random package as a sub-package of the Numpy in Python. The package contains algorithms to generate pseudo-random numbers (Sharpsight, 2019). According to The SciPy community (2019), the numpy.ramdom package generates pseudo-random numbers using a combination of a bit generator and a random generator. The bit generator creates sequences of values and the random generator transforms these sequences into statistical distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What Are Pseudo Random Numbers\n",
    "According to Wolfram Research (2019), a pseudo-random number is the name given to a computer-generated random number. Computer Hope (2019) points out that computer generated random numbers are not properly random, because computers are deterministic by design. Because, when a computer is working properly, it's behaviour is predictable, not random. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rubin (2011) cites an article at MIT’s School of Engineering, which clarifies the meaning of the term deterministic as: “if you ask the same question you’ll get the same answer every time.” To quote Sharpsight (2019) \"give a computer the same input, it will produce the same output.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Accordinto to Sharpsight (2019), to resolve the problem of generating “random” numbers, algorithms called Pseudo-Random Number Generators which produce numbers which appear to be random.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets look at some pseudo-random numbers created with the NumPy to see if we can see any pattern."

    "Systematic sampling involves selecting items from an ordered population using a skip or sampling interval. The use of systematic sampling is more appropriate compared to simple random sampling when a project's budget is tight and requires simplicity in execution and understanding the results of a study. Systematic sampling is better than random sampling when data does not exhibit patterns and there is a low risk of data manipulation by a researcher."

    "## How and Why Do We Use Seeds in Generating Pseudo-random Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "*Paraphrase - Sharpsight 2019 - We use np.random.seed when we need to generate random numbers or mimic random processes in NumPy.Computers are generally deterministic, so it’s very difficult to create truly “random” numbers on a computer. Computers get around this by using pseudo-random number generators.These pseudo-random number generators are algorithms that produce numbers that appear random, but are not really random.In order to work properly, pseudo-random number generators require a starting input. We call this starting input a “seed.” The code np.random.seed(0) enables you to provide a seed (i.e., the starting input) for NumPy’s pseudo-random number generator.NumPy then uses the seed and the pseudo-random number generator in conjunction with other functions from the numpy.random namespace to produce certain types of random outputs.Ultimately, creating pseudo-random numbers this way leads to repeatable output, which is good for testing and code sharing.*"
